        <p>Tom Hanks is my favorite actor. He has had a long and impressive career playing everything from a boy trapped in an adult body in "Big", to a battle-hardened soldier in "Saving Private Ryan". I think my favorite part he played was as an AIDS patient in the critically-acclaimed movie "Philadelphia", for which he won both a Golden Globe and an Oscar. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107818/">Click here to learn more about "Philadelphia"</a>!</p>
